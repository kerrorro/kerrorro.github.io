						<p>Focus LCA is a web application designed to streamline the process of running life cycle assessments. Life cycle assessments are commonly run by environmental experts for companies interested in understanding the environmental impacts of particular products or business decisions. While software solutions to automate aspects of the LCA process exist, they have high learning curves stemming from outdated interfaces and required expert knowledge to navigate complex functionality. With the hopes of improving accessibility beyond the environmental expert to product designers and engineers, Focus LCA was created to expediate system modeling and offer more intuitive data visualization. This streamlining of the process can ultimately result in a companyâ€™s improved ability to produce greener products and reduce systematic impacts.

						<p class="details">Focus LCA started at UC Berkeley as the brain child of Jeremy Faludi, a PhD graduate in Mechanical Engineering, whose primary interests lie in sustainable design. For our Master of Engineering capstone project, my teammate, Jonya Chen, and I took on the task of improving life cycle assessment software through two major goals: <br><br>1) Simplifying the process of mocking up a model. <br>2) Displaying environmental impact results more intuitively.

						<p>The project was split into two phases. The first semester was spent user testing various workflow concepts to obtain an understanding of our target users. We drew from a pool of mostly mechanical engineer Master's candidates to test both low and high fidelity prototypes. We felt that they most closely emulated our primary target users: product designers and engineers who may not have had prior exposure to using life cycle assessment software. Luckily during the user testing phase, a team of undergraduate developers hopped on board to kickstart the development process. As such, our capstone project was not only a practice in project management but also in team management.

						<p>We picked up on the development during the second semester where Jonya was primarily responsible with improvements on the model building page, while I handled databases, backend impact calculations, and data visualization. The calculation results were displayed using the Google Charts API with drilldown functionality so that the hierarchy of items added in the model was preserved.

						<p>What makes Focus LCA unique from other life cycle assessment software is its flexibility in adding non-specific items such that models can be generated quickly without knowing the exact details. This saves a lot of time in information gathering which is often the most time-consuming portion of the life cycle assessment process. In order to supplement this flexibility, we also wanted to give a sense for quality of results obtained. Through uncertainty graphs, we could show the range of approximation for the environmental impact results. In application: if users do not know exactly what kind of copper went into the product, they could possibly see that its environmental impact is so low that the uncertainty doesn't make much of a difference. Or perhaps the opposite: where the impact is high, so they know to spend that time identifying exactly what kind of copper it was.
